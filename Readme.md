# Taipei Hackerspace IRC Bot

A simple little bot to do some fun stuff. But not just yet.
At the moment it just keeps the IRC channel alive, and gives
op to a list of admin users. But in the future!

## Working commands

* `!flip`: flip a coin, heads or tails
* `!roll <sides>`: roll a dice, default 6 sided, or if a number given then that
* `!open`: is anyone checked in the space ("are we open?") using SpaceAPI

## License

TL;DR: MIT License, do whatever.
